### 👋 Hello there, I'm Stephanie...
## ... but you can call me Steph

#### You must have found my GitHub page either by accident or by reference of my resumé!

I'm a junior developer since shortly and I've been using GitHub as part of a [BeCode](https://becode.org/) training I attended (10/2020 - 04/2021).
It's showing most of the projects I have been working on during the training.

### 🗂️ My repositories

There's themed solo and group projects based on challenges, some trial and error repo's as well. 
These are made for learning purpose and need some more TLC in order to make them deploy-worthy. 
So please don't mind the imperfections, I've learned a lot by failure 😄 ...

### 🌱 My goal 

To keep on practicing and learning new skills, mainly combining different techniques together and become a kick-ass *senior full-stack developer* one day.
